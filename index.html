 <p style="color:red;">Do you ever feel as if singning in the shower just isn't giving you the same feeling anymore? Maybe you feel you have potential beyond the shower curtain?<br> Your first step past this is recording a song. Of course I know your thinkning this would cost thousands of dollars to do that correctly but actually the process is quite simple and not that expensive.

<p style="color:blue;"> First thing you need in order to start recording your own song is an audio interface.

There are many types of audio interface that are for sale on the internet or at music stores.

<p>     In order to actually start recording music you need to download software called a "DAW".<br>This is something that allows you to actually record the audio you record from you microphone into your computer. When you buy an interface new, usually it comes with a DAW included when you buy it. Professional programs like pro tools will cost a lot of money seperatly but there are programs that are free online such as audacity.

    Once you download a DAW your pretty much set all you have to do now is set up your microphone and your set up to make the next number one hit song!</p>
